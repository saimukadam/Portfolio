## 📌 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of Level 1 – Task 2 during my internship at Codveda Technologies.

The objective of this task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the cleaned Customer Churn dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between features.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Dataset: cleaned_dataset.csv
- Domain: Customer Churn Analysis
- Total Records: 2666
- Total Features: 20

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
- Visualize data distributions using histograms
- Detect outliers using boxplots
- Analyze feature relationships using scatter plots
- Generate correlation matrix for numerical features

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Dataset Overview
- Loaded dataset using read_csv()
- Checked shape and data types
- Generated summary statistics using describe()

### 2️⃣ Summary Statistics
- Calculated mean, median, mode
- Computed standard deviation
- Analyzed numerical features

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization

- Histogram for distribution analysis
- Boxplot for outlier detection
- Scatter plot to analyze relationship between:
  - Total Day Minutes and Total Day Charge

### 4️⃣ Correlation Analysis

- Filtered numerical columns
- Generated heatmap using correlation matrix
- Identified strong positive relationships between usage and charges

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Strong positive correlation between usage minutes and charges
- Most customers fall within moderate usage range
- Presence of some high-usage outliers
- Churn distribution shows imbalance

**Internship:** Oasis Infobyte  
**Domain:** Data Analytics  
**Project:** Customer Segmentation using K-Means  

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing and spending behavior using **K-Means Clustering**.  
This segmentation helps businesses understand different customer types and design targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 🧠 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration** – Checked data types, missing values, and removed duplicates.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Created a new feature `TotalSpending` combining product spending columns.  
3. **Feature Scaling** – Standardized features using `StandardScaler` for fair clustering.  
4. **K-Means Clustering** – Applied clustering with 4 segments to group similar customers.  
5. **Visualization** – Used scatter plots and bar charts to interpret segment patterns.  
6. **Segment Profiling** – Derived behavioral insights for each customer segment.

# 💳 Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

### 📌 Internship: Oasis Infobyte – Data Analytics Domain

---

### 🎯 Objective
To detect fraudulent transactions from large financial datasets using machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques.

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identify abnormal spending or transaction patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create meaningful variables from raw data.
- **Model Training:** Train models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation:** Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.

---

### ⚙️ Steps & Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values and standardized numeric columns.
   - Encoded categorical features and balanced class distribution.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Visualized transaction amount distribution and correlation patterns.
   - Used boxplots and histograms to identify anomalies.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
   - Compared models and tuned hyperparameters for accuracy improvement.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Used confusion matrix and classification report for validation.
   - Random Forest achieved the best accuracy.

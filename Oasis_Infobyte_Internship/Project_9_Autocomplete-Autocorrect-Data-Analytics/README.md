# 🔤 Autocomplete and Autocorrect Data Analytics

### 📌 Internship: Oasis Infobyte – Data Analytics Domain  

---

### 🎯 Objective
To analyze and enhance the performance of autocomplete and autocorrect systems using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
The project focuses on improving text prediction accuracy and optimizing error correction in user inputs.

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts
1. **Dataset Preparation:** Cleaned and standardized text data for training.  
2. **NLP Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.  
3. **Autocomplete:** Implemented prediction algorithms to suggest next words/phrases.  
4. **Autocorrect:** Designed word correction logic using edit distances and language models.  
5. **Evaluation:** Measured performance using accuracy, word similarity, and response time.

### ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Removed unnecessary punctuation, stopwords, and symbols.  
   - Standardized text to lowercase for consistent analysis.  

2. **Feature Extraction:**  
   - Used n-grams and frequency distributions to predict next probable words.  

3. **Model Implementation:**  
   - Applied simple probability-based models for autocomplete.  
   - Used edit distance algorithm for autocorrect optimization.  

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Levenshtein distance (edit distance)  
   - Response time analysis
